Walter: What is it, I’ll be happy to help.

Regina: Well, imagine you have a clean, white piece of material. Like table linen, right?
Eric: Ok.
Regina: U imagine something you want to draw on it and then take a pencil and draw it.
Eric: Bt that's destroying it!
Regina: Not so fast! After you've finished with the drawing you take some fibre and threads and start embroidering!
Eric: And that's how you get a nice pattern on table linen?
Regina: Ofc. Sure, you can buy something machine-made, but making ur own is far more satisfying!
Eric: I'm quite sure it is. So how long does it take you?
Regina: Depends on the size and material.
Eric: Well, usually. Nothing special.
Regina: More or less 3 months.
Eric: 3 months?!
Regina: Yeah. If I had more time, probably faster, bt u know work, friends, housework and stuff.
Eric: Right! Forgot about the stuff. ;)
Regina: If you want me to embroider something 4 u someday, don't mock me :P
Eric: What would u make 4 me? :) curious!
Regina: What do you want?
Eric: Oh, a small cloth I could put on the table.
Regina: Done.

13730410,"Diana: How much do you charge for an hour lesson?
Kas: It is 12GBP per hour in house plus milage.
Kas: At the moment I have the following slots available: Weekends, after 4pm on Thursday and all day Friday.
Diana: I would want lessons for my 12 year old daughter. Do you teach children?
Kas: Yes we do although we mainly teach adults.
Diana: We live in Nailsea. Can you come and teach her on Tuesdays at 4pm?
Kas: Unfortunately Tuesdays are already fully booked. But I can teach her on Thursday or Friday. However I would have to charge milage to come out.
Kas: Milage is 50p per mile there and back.
Kas: Nialsea is 10 miles from us so that would make 22GBP per hour if I come out to you.
Diana: That is really expensive. Fuel doesn't cost that much!!!
Kas: That's true but I have to charge for my time and travel time is still time.
Diana: OK. Thanks for the info. We'll think about it.
Kas: If you want to keep the costs down you can always come to our place. We do teach from home."

13821327,"Laura: Hello everyone! What are we doing on Saturday? Brain storm, please!
Isabel: I think each kid should be siting alone. We need to make it difficult for them to run around the classroom and talk to each other. Everyone will hopefully focus on making decorations then.
Henry: I’m not sure… I wasn’t there last time, but I don’t think we should create a ‘school atmosphere’, if you know what I mean.
Isabel: We need to maintain discipline. It was a real challenge last time.
Henry: Ok, I understand.
Laura: We tried to treat them as partners, but it didn’t work out. We probably need to take a new approach. I promise to be harsh. I hate to say that, but I strongly encourage you to be harsh as well. They really need to learn that they have to respect us and our time.
Henry: You’re probably right. Now I think Isabel’s idea sounds fine.
Laura: Trust me. I wish I knew what to do. But I’m lost. I need your advice. What do you think Jessie?
Jessie: I was thinking of making a big table. Because it’s a meeting for everyone!
Claire: In my opinion we made big mistake in the beginning of a last meeting. The boys were naughty, and we did not react to their bad behavior. We can try to be more assertive and talk to them when we see that they can’t focus on the activity. I believe we didn’t show enough interest last time.
Jessie: Each kid should have someone to help as well.
Laura: Ok, I got it. Thank you for expressing your opinions. We will make a big round circle with a hole inside. That will simplify the access to all the tables, so the instructor can freely move around and supervise activities."

Hillary: I ordered some things from Yahoo Auctions
Vanessa: You've been waiting but it was already there?
Hillary: But then I got two emails
Hillary: As if it was shipped in two separate packages
Hillary: And I got one, but not the other one - I can’t have them delivered to home, so I use a service in Japan where they collect packages for me and then send them all at once when I request it
Hillary: But now it turns out that I might have been mistaken, I thought I’d ordered more than I actually had
Hillary: And it was all shipped at once, I just misunderstood
Hillary: That’s what I think it is
Hillary: I’ve been waiting for the other package to arrive so I could have everything shipped here, but there’s probably no other package
Hillary: It’s just… me and my mistake
Vanessa: Ahhh
Vanessa: Happens to the best
Vanessa: If it were me, I'd probably think the same, I don't understand Japanese at all, haha"

Nicole: Well, it comes with it's challenges. He and I have very different attitudes towards living space. I mean as long as he has a place to sleep, he basically doesn't care how his apartment looks. As for me, I like to have a home it's nice to come back to.
Jackie: I feel you. It was the same when I first moved in with Bob, but let me tell you, it's possible to get rid of those habits. Just takes some years of practice unfortunately ;)
Nicole: yeah... years, that's what I was afraid of. I mean aside from these aesthetic differences it's great living with him. And on the bright side, he REALLY doesn't care how his apartment looks like so he doesn't mind me redecorating it :P
Jackie: Same with Bob :) But seriously, now he's like a different man - he actually actively wants to have nice things in the house.

Lydia: hahaha you read my mind
Lydia: I don't have anything against them. Larry's great as a person, but I don't think he's a good manager, he loses his temper too easily
Frank: And Ben's more of a uni teacher than a manager, he's nice and chatty, but I saw him in action a couple of times and... well... the guy's afraid of his own shadow
Lydia: Exactly! It's a such a pity Cindy left, thanks to her everything seemed more sane
Frank: I wasn't a great fan of hers
Lydia: yeah but she was so much better than Jake is, he's terrible, so full of himself
Lydia: You can see how stressed his PA is, the girl's trembling all the time, when she worked for Cindy she was so relaxed and easy going!

Jess: Oh, of course, could you just do it for the rest of this term, then, 2 months or so, I think? I can sort out a childminder or something for afterwards.

Mollie: Please do! I love all your stories but this one cuts the cake. :) I'm glad to hear you're feeling better :D and have fun Beta-ing! :P
Mollie: P.S. Can I ask dor a small-ish favour? Could you make Clara say (in that last chapter): ""run you clever boy"" or something like that? If not I get it :P
Ash: I'm not sure if I can in the last chapter, BUT I was thinking about it...I might be able to make another itty bitty cameo with he...and I might be able to have her say it... I gotta think about how to incorporate it! 
Mollie: There is an option to edit chapters - it's really weird but manageable. Wither way, having Clara back would be exciting :D
Ash: Yeah... I know how to do that. I just wasn't sure if it made sense for her to say ""clever boy."" But I'm gonna try to have her pop back in. Maybe in the last chapter. Want to make such a lovely reviewer happy :)
Ash: Maybe this will make up for it until we get there? 
Ash: <file_other>
Mollie: Hey!! I'm so sorry I didn't reply earlier - I had a couple of trips going on and literally no time to check the Internet!!! :( Now my Inbox is stuffed with emails that need replying -_-
Mollie: Anyhoo, can I say how honoured I am that I got to see a sneak peek of the chapter (do you do this to all of your reviewers?? ;) ) and how much it made me want to read more! The chapter's lovely; I can't wait to see everyone;s reactions to Ian's presence in New York. :D
Mollie: One technical issue though - how on earth are you going to explain Ian's incredible late workload? Sorry, i'm just being picky... :P
Ash: I'm glad you like the preview! No I only give certain people previews. If their comments have really touched me then I usually try to show my thanks by sending a preview. Chapter 27 picks up a couple months after Ian and Roses reconciliation. Ian did work in certain parts, like all day in Little Talks and several others. But you are right that he is behind, and I will make a comment to address that! Gotta keep ya all happy!!! ;) 
Mollie: Out of curiosity though, are you ever going to have Ian tell Rose about switching realities experience??
Mollie: You could always have that as additional chapter, or you could have a chapter showing everyone's reactions to Ian and Rose being toegther (that would always be worth reading! :P) Either way, you have fun writing :D
Ash: It's not my plan to have him reveal it. It was about the realization for Ian. About him seeing the truth that's always been there. I never felt that he needed to tell her about it. He just needed her.
Mollie: Awww, that last line *Swoon*
Mollie: But sure, it is your story :) You can do whatever you want :P
Mollie: What I keep wondering is what will happen to Ian once he reached 2025 in his own timeline, how will he react ect. Sorry for bugging you like this, it's all very interesting :P 
Ash: I hope I didn't come across rude!!! I wasn't at all trying to do that!!! I've had that question before. It's all a bit timey wimey and weird. It's not like Quantum Leap where one replaces the original and the ""original"" is somewhere.
Ash: It's more of he was given this gift of jumping forward, so see what his life is/what it could be. But he had to make the decision if he was going to follow through. Was he going to make it happen, or was he going to give up the one thing in his life that made it precious? Was he going to fight for Rose? Was he going to believe that she loved him and allow himself that love? Paradox-y yes. Does that help? 
Mollie: No, you didn't come off as rude - if anything, it made me think to myself: well done, you've just offended the author"" :P
Mollie: As for your explanation... er yeah kinda? I get why you did it for the plot (which also makes the plot more interesting), I'm just imaging Ian's reactions when he finally reaches 2025 and and thinks about how he woul have jumped timelines every day... am I making sense? Think of it as me creating a fanfic in my head of an actual fanfic :P"

Donna: I think it’s interesting and also gives you a nice overview of the subject (which is what you desire 🔥 if you’re not planning on reading everything)
Keith: Yeah, that one is good. I’d also say read Regan
Keith: The titles goes along the lines of “War Toys, Movies … & Militarization”
Keith: It’s in the bibliography Mary gave us
Tim: It’s “War Toys, War Movies, and the Militarization of the United States”
Tim: by Reagan, R.
Keith: Oh wait… WAT??? 😹😹😹
Tim: 🤣🤣🤣
Donna: How confusing 😂
Agnes: I’ll remember the title and the author
Agnes: Forever
Agnes: Any other suggestions?
Tim: Well, it would be an obvious choice to read a couple of chapter from Mary’s book
Keith: It’s titled “Wounding Mars”
Keith: Or was it “Wounding Venus”?
Agnes: LOOOOL
Agnes: Guys this was an innocent question about readings for a seminar in cultural history, you can’t be treating me like this. I’m an adult student, I have a job, I have yet another job, I have a child

Debbie: You know that Abigail from Chalfont?
Ruth: The one whose father is a pastor?
Debbie: Yeah. That one. You won't believe it, but she is pregnant.
Ruth: You are joking?  
Debbie: I'm not. She is showing already.
Ruth: Of course, her parents are never going to let her have an abortion, so that's it for her, game over.
Debbie: and the shame for them, him being a pastor and everything. Word is, he will have to give up being a pastor as he didn't bring his kids up right.  So they are going to be out of the house they have, he isn't really trained for anything else, it's a complete disaster.
Ruth: Bloody hell, I feel bad for them. Can't the church help them out a bit? Its not very Christian, is it, just chucking him out.
Debbie: I agree. They say he has brought scandal but they are the ones who are making this a scandal.
Ruth: Silly girl, though. She's caused no end of trouble. Who's the father anyway?
Debbie: You know Trevor. She has been seeing him for a while. Only in secret as her dad wouldn't let her go out with anyone.
Ruth: Is he standing by her?
Debbie: Yes, he wants to do the decent thing and he says he wants to marry her, but his family are all upset because he was supposed to be going to Uni and now he won't be able to. He will have to start work. His dad will give him a role in his buidling firm as an apprentice.
Ruth: It is a waste of his career.
Debbie: Some people say he is lucky. Abigail is a very nice girl, they clearly do love each other, and he was going to do a useless degree on history and now he will learn to build houses and end up with no student debts and probably as rich as his own dad in ten years from now.
Ruth: Really? So Abigail probably made a logical move then.
Debbie: I doubt she was thinking with her brain, but in fact it should be ok  for her. Its her family and her old man not having a job because of it which is the one to be pitied, I suppose.
Ruth: Maybe Trevor's dad will be able to give Abigail's Dad a job as well?
Debbie: Her mother earns quite well as a bookkeeper, so maybe they will be OK, but it is sad that he won't be able to work at his calling any more.
Ruth: They should just send him to be pastor in a new place, where nobody will hear of this.
Debbie: Yeah. Like the Outer Hebrides. "

13682558,"Zoe: We saw the oncologist today and finally know where we stand. No rush, he said, so we are relieved.
Sophie: Which therapy has he recommended?
Zoe: He reassured Bill that it's almost not recommended to have the Brachytherapy at his low level of cancer.
Sophie: Is it the one with radiation elements working from inside?
Zoe: That's right. But he says that due to the cancer being in both lobes he will do it but there is no rush. So the tension has eased off.
Sophie: Is it because there is so little cancer in the lobes?
Zoe: That's how I understand it. But there is also Bill's heart condition. The oncologist will confirm with the cardiologist when Bill can come off the blood thinner and then will perform the op.
Sophie: We were told when it was under consideration for Wolf that the op itself is a micro op, without cutting through the skin and all that.
Zoe: That's right. 40 radioactive seeds 4 mm x 1,8 mm will be inserted into the prostate via some microsurgery procedure. No scars at all.
Sophie: How long does it take to get rid of the cancerogenous tissue?
Zoe: Radiation lasts 2 years diminishing in strength every 6 months by half. And he won't be even aware of their working.
Sophie: So it is quite good news, isn't it?
Zoe: Oh yes. Bill is very happy after seeing the doctor today.
Sophie: Aren't we lucky to live in these times of really successful medicine?
Zoe: Very much so. Medicine is advancing so rapidly that we all should live to around 90 or 100 years...
Sophie: Let's wait and see! Anyway give Bill our love!"

Alan: Not really. Doctor, I have these swellings under my armpit! That's alright I'll tell you a joke.
Simon: Any more?
Alan: A stitch in time saves nine. I don't understand how you can stitch time in the first place, and why it should save nine instead of seven or eleven, for example.
Simon: That was the original title of the Outlander novel, you know?
Alan: What ""A Stitch in Time saves Nine?""
Simon: No, just ""A stitch in time"". That was what Diana Gabaldon called it. Later on they changed the further issues of Book one to Outlander and called it the Outlander series and the TV shows were always just called Outlander.
Alan: About the best historical drama ever made, in my opinion. Really insightful about the eighteenth century. You can almosot feel as if you have lived in it.
Simon: I agree. The only better series I know is Breaking Bad, but that's a completely different genre.
Alan: Both BB and Outlander are hard to cast when it comes to genre. I would say they transcend genre. But you are right, they are very different. 
Simon: which do you like better?
Alan: I would still say that BB is the single best TV series ever made, and that by a wide margin. However, once you have seen it from beginning to end and you know what is coming, you don't want to watch it again.
Simon: Right. Whereas you can watch all the Outlander series several times just for the historical insight and the atmosphere as well as the artistic beauty of the scenes and cinematography.
Alan: Yes and Catriona Balfe
Simon: Indeed. There's nobody on Breaking Bad who quite equals her, is there?
Alan: I quite liked Marie Schrader and Jessie's girlfriend who chokes on her own vomit, but Skyler is not exactly my type:
Simon: No. And anyway none of them can hold a candle to Catriona. 
Alan: She's a gorgeous woman and a fantastic actress.

Iona: I'm already on the train to B'ham.

Jack: The arguments they used were so absurd!
Luke: I was laughing with Maggie.
Jack: You were laughing. I was paralysed. I couldn't believe my ears.
Luke: Do you know that they are not alone in thinking that way?
Jack: I know. I know at least 10 people in our office who support them blindly.
Luke: Blindly, That's just the word.
Jack: Sooner or later they will wake up.
Luke: Better sooner than later. Though I doubt it.
Jack: Why?
Luke: They feel good in this situation. They don't see anything improper, illogical or unethical in it. 
Jack: That's madness.
Luke: Just face it. They have such a comfy life right now. Never before has it been like that. They will not suddenly vote for someone who will deprive them of those priviledges. Would you?
Jack: I would think. THINK. That's what I'd do. Think for myself and not what they want me to think.
Luke: Well, you and I, the likes of us are in the minority now.

13681128,"Bethany: Hi, Callum, I have a question.
Callum: What is it? Can't you just ask google?
Bethany: You're better, hahahah.
Callum: Hahah, thanks.
Bethany: So, what is it ""sounding""
Callum: it's also called ""cockstuffing""
Bethany: sounds weird.
Callum: it's a BDSM/kink practice.
Bethany: And you shove things into your penis?
Callum: yes, that's what they do!
Bethany: Anything?
Callum: of course not, here is some wikipedia: ""Urethral play can involve the introduction of either soft or rigid items into the meatus of the penis (as well as farther in). Objects such as sounds are usually only inserted about halfway into the glans and can usually be easily retrieved.""
Bethany: Isn't it dangerous?
Callum: Theoretically it is, if you don't do it carefully. But people who practice it claim it's not, and allegedly it's quite pleasant and stimulating.
Bethany: Oh, I was wondering why would anybody do it?
Callum: But you can have the same question for many things we do in life, right? Why do people go bungee jumping?
Bethany: Right.
Callum: But sounding is supposed to stimulate, it's pleasant as the people claim, also the idea of penetration is stimulating for some of them.
Bethany: Are there special objects for it?
Callum: Sure, you can even buy a sounding-kit, you'll find everything on the internet. 
Bethany: The whole new world for me!
Callum: Haha, but good to know:)
Bethany: oh, sure!"

Chris: I was thinking about that. But I was thinking to hold off until after Christmas. I'll see, maybe things will improve. 
Kate: Ok, it's up to you. You know the situation best.
Chris: What would you do?
Kate: Well, they'll find out sooner or later. I mean, they just have to look at the logs and they'll know. It's better to come forward before they say anything.
Chris: Yeah, I know. So, you think I should mention something before Christmas?
Kate: I think so ;)

13829027,"Micky: Hello Birgit! Many thanks you the NY greetings. What was 2018 like for you then? 
Helen: It has not been a good year for injuries, I'm afraid.
Helen: My bad back (bulging disc) I have had for 30 years now, and I manage it pretty well most of the time. As long as I keep fairly fit (especially my “core” muscles), it is not a big problem, as long as I don’t stand or walk slowly! I can run, walk fast, cycle, kayak, swim anything really, and all of these activities are good for me, but standing still is a real trial.
Micky: How can you manage everyday life without standing?!
Helen: Most of the time I can avoid standing, and have no problems at all, but it makes visiting art galleries and museums, and parties, a lot more difficult.
Micky: One can give museums a miss, but not parties. How about carrying one of these portable folding chairs with you?
Helen: Got one! But I feel silly with it.
Helen: This year I pushed to get a proper diagnosis of a hip which has been giving me problems on and off for 3 years. It proves to be in need of replacement..
Micky: You mentioned that at Robert's do. When do you intend to have it done?
Helen: Not sure but I did a lot of phoning round of friends in the medical profession (doctors, surgeons, physios, nurses etc – 14 of them). With one exception they all said to leave it as long as possible. I also spoke to about 11 friends who had had the operation. Every one of them said it was the best thing they had ever done, and to book it in as soon as possible! So that was really helpful!
Micky: Don't you have one surgeon with an overview of your bones' condition? I've got one myself since the first symptoms of arthritis.
Helen: My GP said exercise as much as you can, and if it hurts, keep taking the painkillers! So at the moment that is what I am doing. I have decided to give it a year, and see how the land lies then.
Micky: Sounds sensible. I refused that my knee be operated on 2 years ago and I'm still going strong.
Helen: Exactly! They operate much too often. As long as I can practise sport and have my activities filled holidays I won't get under their knives.
Micky: <file_photo> It's me in the gym the other day. Talking about operations...
Helen: My point exactly!
Helen: <file_photo> And me on a cycling tour in Morocco earlier this year. We shouldn't complain!
Micky: Chins up!"

George: For example, what do you guys give to married couple?
George: Random gifts, money...
George: A slap on their butt??
George: :D:D:D
Tomek: So it goes like that: we go to the church for ceremony. After that young couple is receiving gifts from guests, it's in front of the church. Nowadays usually money, typically about ~300 PLN per couple, but if you're short on cash you don't have to give anything, no pressure here. Then you wish them quick divorce and you step back so other guests can make it rain as well ;)
George: So money is right choice
George: Hahhah
Tomek: But you're coming all the way here, I'm sure your presence will be the best gift for them
George: Yeah, nah
George: It wouldn't be a nice thing to do

Rob: Yeah, I know. Plus I can always get a small loan and pay it off slowly.
Gina: Better than waiting till 2022. Is it painful?
Rob: I have no idea. It would be arthroscopic surgery, so it's minimally invasive, I guess.
Gina: Ok, that's not too bad. My uncle's had arthroscopy done. He was out and about 2 days after he got out of the hospital.
Rob: Hmm... that doesn't sound too bad. I've read a lot of blogs on it. Everyone says something different.
Gina: I don't think you should worry too much about it. What can happen if you don't do anything?
Rob: Well, it could get a lot worse, damaging other parts of the knee. Plus I avoid certain movements now. I'm afraid of the knee locking up, and that's PAINFUL!
Gina: That's not good. Just sign up for the surgery. I can help you out a little with the cost.
Rob: It's ok, don't worry. I'll go to the bank and get a loan.
Gina: The interest's going to be high. If I lend you a little, you won't have to borrow that much.

Rob: You all fancy pizza for tonight?
Steve: Hmm, not sure, I'll ask everyone.
Rob: OK.
Steve: Well, Mum would like fish and chips, Karen wants a Chinese meal and me and the kids are fine with pizza.
Rob: OK, that's awkward! Can you persuade Mum or Karen to change their mind, I really don't want to go to 3 places!
Steve: Just asked, Karen says pizza is far too carby and thinks Chinese is better in that respect, Mum doesn't like pizza much but could stand some Chinese food.
Rob: We have a very difficult family! Ok, I'll stop at the 2 places. Right, what about orders?
Steve: Right, me and Danny like pepperoni, Suki wants a chicken and bbq sauce pizza, Mum wants lemon chicken and special fried rice, Karen wants chicken with mushrooms, spicy veg and plain rice.
Rob: OK, sounds clear enough. Now, what time do you want to eat?
Steve: About 6/6.30?
Rob: Right, I'll ring and go get it at 5.45ish. Oh, just remembered, the pizza place delivers so I only have to visit the Chinese place! Got any wine or other drinks?
Steve: Umm, no, actually. Could you get a couple of bottles of white wine and some sugar free squash or pop for the kids?
Rob: Well, that means I still have to go to 2 places! Can't you or Karen go?
Steve: Oh, well, we've already had a couple of beers each, it is the Christmas hols, you know!🎄😁
Rob: I suppose I have to stop and get the drinks too, then 😒. Some bloody relaxing holiday for me!
Steve: Don't be arsey, you only see us all a few times a year! Look, how about you and me popping down the pub tomorrow?
Rob: Maybe, but you can pay your rounds this time!
Steve: Well, I had no cash on me at Easter! Only a one-off!
Rob: It'd better be! Make sure you go to the cash point before we go out tomorrow! Oh, and I will want you or Karen to pay your share of the take away this time!!!!

Laura: Just told you we both would.
Ethy: Nice of you! Peter will be happy to see you. But certainly you know everything he's going to talk about.
Laura: Not exactly as he always finds out new details. It will be new to Ed though.
Laura: Shall we have a drink afterwards?
Ethy: That depends on Peter's condition. Only if he's not too tired. Then he'd only want to go home.
Laura: Sure enough. Just a suggestion. So let's hope the weather keeps and Peter's lecture will be well attended.

Jenny: They are free to go away any minute
Ann: Or a Disney princess (I am watching sleeping beauty now on TV)
Kelly: 😂😂😂 Yes, so they have the right to leave us and we should be able to see life after them always
Ann: Yes, this is the biggest problem of the ideology of love. The idea that love is life. Love has been equated with life. Especially for women, but not only, also for men. People can't imagine life without it
Kelly: Yes, but we love this dream of life that is love and love that is life
Ann: And this creates dependency, jealousy, frustrations, drama
Ann: It's not even a very beautiful dream to be with someone all your life. The promise of no change. Stability forever. It is what capitalism needs from us - 40 years of mortgage and marriage
Kelly: Ahaha, yes and that somebody will take care of us when we are sick. 
Ann: Love is beautiful, intense, crazy and brief. And it was transformed in a long lasting good, a house. Something like this.
Kelly: But i think, or I suppose that we should be able to love for life potentially. We cannot approach love with a plan
Ann: Yes, sure, but a substantial group of people, not one. But the problem is that love is mostly approached with one plan. Being together, get married, etc
Ann: Or now, under the new regime of supposed sexual freedom, with the opposite plan: nothings lasts and love doesn't matter. But this is substituting an ideology with another, when we should just let it be.
Ann: Simply 😅
Kelly: Yes, I agree
Jenny: and most of all this myth of love as life is a disappointing lie that makes people suffer a lot
Ann: Yes, the dependency that it creates is horrible
Ann: I see it with my friends, it breaks my heart

Sandra: What led you to this conclusion? ;)
Jane: I went to the cinema and they were showing the last trailer of that new Lars von Trier film
Brian: The House That Jack Built?
Jane: Exactly! So, I used to love films like that, you know with serial killers, psychopaths, quite gore and everything, but yesterday I could barely watch the trailer
Sandra: I've heard people were going out of the screening because it was too much
Brian: Yeah, he's famous of doing films to hard to handle
Jane: It's not that. I watched his previous films, I watched more hardcorde films, but I was... bored? 
Brian: Bored? At the trailer? How long is it? 2 minutes? :D
Jane: Hahahaha, it wasn't too long :P
Jane: I was bored because it was boring. That's why I think I'm just getting old. A couple of years ago I would be crazy excited about this film.
Jane: Now I'm only thinking - another serial killer, another film about psychopaths and murderers, it seems awfully tedious
Sandra: I think I get what you mean
Brian: Maybe it's different and you should give it a shot? The same rule applies to films about love
Jane: I guess so, but I now kind of enjoy more films in which people don't murder each other
Jane: Maybe it is the age thing after all, I don't think I can handle all those negative emotions to that extent
Sandra: I never liked films like that exactly because of that
Sandra: You can just watch daily news instead of an horror
Brian: I'd give it a go if I were you, wait a bit and watch it. I've heard it's a masterpiece
Jane: Well, maybe, will see, now I don't feel like watching. I was yawning at the trailer"

Jim: it is extremely well prepared and presented, even for someone who knows the subject quite well
Jim: I found out a lot from this exhibition
Zac: Would you do anything differently? Do you have any critical remarks to share?
Jim: hmm, nothing really critical. I just had some ideas, what else could be presented or added
Zac: like what?
Jim: they show this beautiful project for Skopje, after the big earthquake
Jim: when Yugoslavia together with the UN prepared a huge plan to rebuilt the destroyed city
Jim: this is a project that became a part of history of architecture and urbanism
Zac: it seems so
Jim: but what is also very interesting is what happened afterwards
Jim: when they abandoned the project, criticised it and most of all the new project - Skopje 2014
Jenny: I heard it's horrible
Jim: it us a nightmare. So Skopje transformed from a city that was planned to have the best architecture in the world to a city with arguably the ugliest, most kitschy buildings

Simone: It's actually a minor thing. I wouldn't want to betray his trust and privacy by telling you though...
Anna: You can tell me. Please I assure you everything will stay just between us. I can’t just sit here and think about how he’s suffering…
Simone: Don’t worry Mrs. Meyer. It’s really not that bad. You know those red pants he’s been wearing lately?
Anna: Yes…
Simone: Well, other boys keep laughing at him that in those pants and with his long hair he looks like a girl
Anna: Oh boy
Simone: Indeed. Difficult pill to swallow for an 11-year-old. 
Anna: I’ll burn those pants tomorrow.
Simone: If I may suggest something. Try an accidental stain, one of those impossible to remove. Make it seem natural. Let us let the little guy keep his dignity at least at home…
Anna: Right. Thank you very much Mrs. Wilhelm. You were great help. Thanks!
Simone: No problem. Glad I could help."

Julia: And the media presenting both candidates are also guilty right?

Olivier: I am sorry. But why actually?
Ian: Hard to say. There is no need to be angry, no is no, she has the right to say no.
Olivier: yes, she does...
Ian: I think she is generally panicked, like afraid of the divorce proceedings and she doesn't feel entirely entitled since she believes to be ""a fake Italian"".
Olivier: Because she was born in Romania?
Ian: Exactly. It's completely ridiculous, before going to the US she even called the embassy to ask if the same procedure applies to her as ""a fake Italian"". She thinks to be a kind of a second class citizen.

Sharon: How was Portugal this time?
Deirdre: Not too great, actually! Just finished my email to Vivaldi head office.
Sharon: Why, what happened? You usually have a great time.
Deirdre: Well, we do, but the complex has been taken over by new management and they are a bunch of lazy twats, not to put too fine a point on it!
Sharon: Oh my God, what did they do?
Deirdre: How long have you got! First, we booked in and they'd given away the only ground floor apartment available to someone else, so I was cross to begin with. I was watching little Ben like a hawk around that balcony. I did specify ground floor only when we booked too!
Sharon: How irritating!
Deirdre: Exactly! Well, next day, we all decided to go in the pool, James and Ben went in the toddler pool and I took Rosie and Megan in the big one with me as they can swim pretty well. Next thing we know, we have to get out as our eyes are streaming and Ben has grabbed a large floating toddler poo from his pool and is playing with it!
Sharon: That's vile, was it chemicals in the pool that did it?
Deirdre: Yep, far too much chlorine, awful. We could hardly see for a couple of hours and both pools were evacuated immediately, of course! So not a great first day!
Sharon: You poor things, did  everything improve at all later?
Deirdre: Not really! They did have some great entertainment at night, to be fair, but every other night, they seemed to carry on playing music until 2 or 3 am AND we were right over the bar and restaurant. Awful! We did complain, but nothing was done about it.
Sharon: How was the food?
Deirdre: Nice actually, most of the time, but there was so little of it, we were still hungry. The girls being 12 are growing like weeds and need decent amounts. I thought half board would be good, but we had to buy snacks quite a lot of the time to fill the gaps!
Sharon: That Vivaldi lot really are shit! The tv adverts make them sound really high end.
Deirdre: Well, we're obviously asking for compensation, especially because of the chlorine incident. A lot of people are furious, you should see the comments on Trip Advisor!
Sharon: Gosh, I hope you manage to sort it, what a pain!
Deirdre: Yes, we are certainly not going to that place again. Luckily, the timeshares in the UK have all been fab. Anyway, see you next week, Sharon! Cut and blow dry, Tues. at 6pm, wasn't it?
Sharon: Yes, my love. Good luck with your complaint, Bye!"

Tori: uhh yeah, it's tinder, what did you expect?
Katie: yeah, well I know. but I mean, it's still regular people. And the guy seemed nice in the pics. 
Tori: haha yeah yeah, but pics are one thing.. He was so fucking boring. I think that was the worst part.
Katie: yeah but boring doesn't automatically mean that it's bad 
Tori: well, it kinda does when you're me and don't know how to get out of the situation
Katie: haha well I just think your standards might be a little too high 
Tori: lol. my standards are too high cause I don't want someone boring?!
Katie: well nooo, but  I think you should give someone another chance, and not cross them off just cause they came off as boring in the first meeting. Maybe he was just shy!
Tori: oh god. yeah. that's for sure. 
Katie: see, so there ya go. 
Tori: yeah, but if you're so shy and like afraid of me, to the point where I have to keep up the entire conversation, that gets pretty exhausting pretty quick. 
Katie: mm yeah, I know what you mean. but either way, I think you could give him another chance.
Tori: ha, ok. I'll think about it. but just for you, and cause you asked nicely. 
Katie: hahaha ok, thanks, that makes me very happy :)

Jen: Has he at least paid the bills and rent?
Anna: Are you kidding. He expects me to do it cause it is my house.

Jen: Yeah exactly. He's a fucking parasite. Get rid of him!
Anna: But I need him for the heavy work around the property that I can't do myself.
Jen: Like what?
Anna: Like chopping the firewood. I can't do it on my own.
Anna: It's the only way to heat this house and without the wood I'd freeze in winter.
Jen: So you're keeping a nasty parasite around for firewood? You gotta ask yourself is it worth it?

Duncan: damn
Linda: Added an element of excitement to the night I REALLY didn't need. And when they turned up, no streetlights either. So they couldn't see our number. And since they've never been to ours before they ran around in the rain getting soaked while I was up on the balcony shouting HERE HERE  😭

Tessa Rick: But of course I did. You'll find them on my desk in the out-tray. I don't think I remember you ever asking to have them on you desk.
Will Chards: Oh I'm sorry. It must have been a misunderstanding. I hope the stand-in will cope with taking minutes of this conference. I'm not very happy about your holidays precisely at this time of the year.
Tessa Rick: I'm sorry to hear that but you gave me your permission long ago. I was unable to change my arrangements. And I am absolutely sure that the stand-in will cope with flying colors. I have trained her more than thoroughly.
Will Chards: I do hope so. So you are back in the country on the 20th of January, as I can see in the planner.
Tessa Rick: That's correct. I'm back in the office on the 22nd, as agreed.

13818926,"Matthew: any of those on here talking about watching videos, listening to tunes or laughing at stuff have clearly never had a full on impending doom, thought looping, time dilated, paranoid, depersonalization attack from doing too much weed. 
Matthew: I know at least 2 people who have suffered protracted post hallucinogen perception disorder from cannabis use and many others who spend their days in a zombified apathetic state smoking it all day.. 
Matthew: it is not a remotely harmless drug despite all the people on here trying to be edgy and cool... i’d goes as far as saying LSD and psilocybin are safer mentally.
Rick: Have you been watching Reefer Madness?
Robert: Matthew, ahhh or we just had that sober as children and moved past it like normal folks eventually realizing that we are going to die and doom is impending and that’s fine.
Basia: Psilocybin is famously extremely safe, so yes, it's very possible that it and LSD are both safer than marijuana. Nevertheless, the risk of serious problems from moderate marijuana use is pretty low for most healthy adults. Not zero risk, but pretty low risk for _most_ people.
Rick: Matthew, I only heard of positive effects of marijuana: relax, unwind, de-stress, relax, unwind, de-stress...
Daniel: Basia, healthy adults are low risk true but most peer reviewed studies show a high risk in users 21 and under.Easy to get caught up in the debate always trust the science.

13680284,"Tessy: Good morning Harry! Just thought I'd drop you a line before disappearing to the other side of the world. At the moment I'm on the train to Frankfurt airport, then off to Cuba for 5 weeks. Can't wait to be there!
Harry: A very good morning to you dear Tessy! How nice you are in touch. So travelling again? Gosh, you've got stamina!
Tessy: I wonder myself. Truth to tell I'm slightly apprehensive. Never been to Cuba. Have you?
Harry: No, I'm not that adventurous but Maya was. Last summer with her boys. And I think she was very enthusiastic.But I remember no details. Why don't you ask her? She may have a tip or two.
Tessy: A bit too late now :)) but I will definitely contact her. Still she can give me a few good tips. Do you remember if internet is really such a disaster there?
Harry: Oh yes, it is. She was gone for 2 weeks and I heard from her twice: from the Havana airport when she arrived and on leaving.
Tessy: I see! My Super Mario boss is expecting me to be online all the time - just in case. LOL
Harry: What a charming person. Have you told him to fuck off?
Tessy: More or less. And hey how are you? Tied down to the ground?
Harry: I hate winter for that reason. But still had a fantastic flying season this year. Can't complain really. We've been thinking about a skiing holiday though at Xmas.
Tessy: Smashing! Where to?
Harry: Actually that's an adventurous part - to Israel. They seem to have some incredible slopes with topnotch infrastructure. A bloke from Notts Club was there last year and couldn't praise it too much.
Tessy: Funny enough I remember seeing their skiing brochures when we were there back in 2000. Sooo long time ago. By now it can be only better. Wouldn't it bit more on a pricey side?
Harry: We'll manage 2 weeks. And it can't be more expensive that Austria.Not to mention Switzerland. They're gone mad there, with all those Chinks and Russkis. Nobody else can afford it any more.
Tessy: Apart from royals in Kitzbühel :)) 
Harry: Molly has found out about a package, with the flight, full board, accommodation. You only have to pay your ski passes.
Tessy: And that's where they are making their money! And on apres-skis!
Harry: I can easily give a miss to a fancy apres-ski! Have you had any bookings? They surely have nice all-inclusive places in Cuba.
Tessy: Not at all! Otherwise prices are exorbitant. But those affordable ones always have horrible write-ups. Yes, I've booked all my accommodation. Airbnb, I like to support the locals :)
Harry: Very noble of you. But it's a bit of a tossup: you can get a superb flat or land in a rubbish hip. I definitely prefer hotels.
Tessy: I AM more adventurous. Anyway it is safe, Cuba is said to be very safe even for woman travelling alone.
Harry: And ravishing blonde on top of it! But be careful.
Tessy: STB you are.
Harry: What the hell is STB?
Tessy: Swet Talking Bastard. Anyway it was great to chat with you. I think we're approaching Frankfurt. So see you in January!
Tessy: And have a fantastic skiing Xmas!
Harry: Happy and safe trails Tessy!"

Mason: Living in a society sometimes gets frustrating, isn't it?
Daniel: It does, especially when you have to deal with such morons like antivaccinators
Mason: I think that unvaccinated kids should be kicked out of their schools.
Mason: They put at risk other children and it's not fair. Of course it's not their fault, but maybe  it would be a wake-up call for their parents.
Daniel: I think they are, at least in several cities.

Bassy: Do you have exercises?
Ali: No. I don't have time. I am busy with my studies. I have to study all the time.

Ali: What do you mean?
Bassy: I mean, a person who studies the whole day and does  exercise his body, he is likely fall ill.
Ali: I still don't get you.
Bassy: Listen. Exercises are very important. When Exams are near, students tend to study the whole day sitting at one place. They suffer from food indigestion. Thus they get sick.
Ali: You may be right.
Bassy: Not may be but I am. Seems like you don't know the importance of exercising your body.
Ali: What should I do then?
Bassy: Exercise regularly either in the morning or in the evening. But in the morning it's better.

Sammy: A long story. Anyway a gay couple, good acquaintances of ours, from Dillon, are just starting a business together with a wine producer - to producer cider. It's a nice drink, tasty, healthy , cheap, and nobody has had such a glorious idea about it in our region so far.
Mama: Maybe if nobody has so far, it's not worth it?
Sammy: But everybody likes cider! The point is they'll buy our apples if we join their business. Well I don't know particulars. Yet.
Mama: Does Michael do?
Sammy: Well, he'll be meeting Oli and Natt, the gay couple, and their wine producer to discuss it all. Keep your fingers crossed please!
Mama: You and your madcap ideas!

Sammy: But we are only investing our apples!! If the business is a flop, we'll have lost only our fruit. The money we'll put in bottles and advertising will be negligible.

Sam: it's wasteful
Tom: So what do you use your laptop for?
Sam: I'm writing my PhD dissertation on it, I have quite many pictures, but that's all

Sam: that would be perfect
Zoe: ok, so in this case changing to a MacBook Air wouldn't be a bad idea
Sam: exactly, that's what I thought, I don't need an expensive computer that has some amazing abilities that I'll never use
Zoe: ok, get yourself one then, there is a new version of it
Zoe: I think they launched it in November
Sam: ok!
Zoe: and if you want to buy it in the US, remember that there are a few states that don't have the sales tax
Sam: which states?
Zoe: I think on the East coast it's Delaware and New Hampshire, but google it

Haley: True that
Nick: So what did you sacrifice?
Haley: Arcadia Bay.
Nick: Srsly?? I was 100% certain, you're going to sacrifice Chloe.
Haley: I mean it wasn't an easy decision, but it made sense to me. What did you choose? 
Nick: I sacrificed Chloe, obviously.
Haley: obviously :P
Haley: You know it's almost 50/50 with this choice among the players
Nick: I've seen the statistics, yes. So why did you choose Chloe?
Haley: Because it's actually the one person that you truly care about. Who's like your best friend and means something to you. You've tried so hard for her and now you're just gonna throw that all away and kill her? I just couldn't do it.
Nick: Yes, but that's one life against several thousands of lives including Chloe's mother. How do you think that would make her feel?
Haley: I know and as I said it was a devastating choice, but I couldn't let her die after all that emotional build-up.
Nick: I sorta get it... in theory. But for me the math was simple. Plus there was this part where you had to see the damage the storm had done and save your classmates and all that. It really got to me.
Haley: I know all that but it was just... pursuit of happiness I guess. Like if it was Josie or your mom, what would you do?
Nick: yeah, but for me it wasn't a Josie/mom kind of relationship. Chloe and Max just spent several days together after some long years of zero contact. I just didn't really feel that close to Chloe, I guess.
Haley: I totally adored her and actually felt guilty a lot o f times on Max's behalf for abandoning her like that those years ago. I know Chloe is difficult and troublesome, but for me that was kinda lovable.
Nick: I didn't connect with her like that at all. I mean it wasn't ok, what Max did, but I feel like Chloe was constantly guilt tripping Max throughout the game. It was kinda annoying.
Haley: i dindn't really see it that way. Chloe's just sorta emotional, says what she feels.
Nick: That's a polite way to put it but ok. :P What about the other choices? And most importantly - did you water the plant? :D
Haley: Yes! :D I watered it exactly right.
Nick: Haha, me too. I wish I was able to do that in real life :P"

Juan: Big applause for all of us 👏 
Danny: 😂
Kirsty: Frankly speaking, it seemed quite easy. I feel much more confident now about the events we'll be organising later on
Danny: Yeah, I thought it would all be much more difficult and, of course, that at least one disaster would befall us at some point, which fortunately didn't happen
Juan: It all went smoothly indeed. I think enough people came as well. The only thing I'd wish for would be better networking... But I guess the quality of event attendees is not really something you have much control over anyway lol
Kirsty: lol you're too critical! Some people were nice 
Juan: 🙊
Danny: Ha ha well, it all goes down to promotion strategies, doesn't it? Next time I'm sure we'll have more time to promote the event on social media, and we can target the audience more consciously
Juan: 🔫
Kirsty: There you go... ha ha
Danny: I was a little surprised by the fact that people were so eager to leave us after the talk ended
Juan: Yeah, they seemed to literally hate the idea of having a beer with us
Kirsty: That's Free Will for you... They loved ❤ acting against their own interest
Juan: Ha ha, yeah that happens. One of these guys we did our miserable little networking with has written to me - inviting me to request a fellowship which is COMPLETELY unrelated to what I'm working on
Danny: Lol, don't forget to reciprocate
Kirsty: Absolutely, don't forget to suggest he applies for a fellowship in a subject opposed to his
Juan: I'm so rude, I just intended not to answer 
Kirsty: Anyway, I'm quite proud of us I must say. We've done a terrific job
Danny: You sound like Trump
Kirsty: Ha ha well then, ""Congratulations guys, you've fulfilled a truly reciprocal undertaking""
Danny: LOL
Juan: 😂😂😂😂
Kirsty: I've had to use a dictionary for this. Anyway THANK YOU
Juan: It was a pleasure ✨

Laura: I wish I could take you in my arms!
Dora: Instead I am cuddling up to me this doll. Oh dear...
Laura: You are such a lovely and sensitive and emotional being.

Soph: One basket or two will be enough!
Samantha: Great! I'll get you a small basketful of cooking apples and a bigger one with different sorts of dessert apples. So happy they'll be put to good use:)
Soph: That sounds a lot! Thank you. I can always share them with my neighbor.
Samantha: I really don't know what to do with them all! We're eating them with everything really and I've made some apple puree and some apple chutney. But what else?
Soph: How about apple juice?
Samantha: But then I'd have to have it pressed. Professionally I mean. Can you have it done somewhere?
Soph: I think last year Oli and Natt took their whole apple harvest to some organic fruiter who's got a processing unit. And in exchange they received an adequate amount of juice.
Samantha: So it wasn't juice from their own apples?
Soph: As I understood it, no. But doesn't matter since it was an organic grower. And I think a friend of theirs or something, they must know each other well, since he accepted their apples and they didn't have any official certificate or anything.
Samantha: That's an idea. Have you got their phone number? Or maybe could you ask them about that organic juice producer? You know Oli better than I.
Soph: I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you! Here's his number 07634 235 987 32.
Samantha: Ta, I'll contact him. Mike's thinking about buying a proper juice maker but I don't fancy all that work. Washing, pressing, bottling, pasteurising... No!
Soph: It's probably not worth it. Better to have it done professionally.
Samantha: My point exactly. Is it ok if I get you the apples tomorrow morning?
Soph: Nobody's home then but you can leave them on the terrace in the back.
Soph: I still have your apple basket. The one Mike'd bought apples last week. I'll put it on the terrace for you.

Melissa: We have already booked the same holiday apartment on Lake Constance we stayed in before. Peter is quite sentimental about it.
Loreen: No, we do not really care about it.
Loreen: A splendid idea. I remember you both liked it very much. How many times have you been in this flat yet?
Melissa: This time it will be our third. Where will you be?
Loreen: In Cuba, I think. But it's not sure yet where exactly. We'll have to do our bookings soon, as we'll probably have no internet there.
Melissa: That's bad! How many weeks in Cuba?
Loreen: 4 Long, eh?
Melissa: Not when you're travelling around. Are you going to rent a car again?
Loreen: No, not in Cuba. Too much hustle. They are said to have cheap and good public transport. Car rentals have rather prohibitive prices.
Melissa: Oh is that so? I thought everything is cheap there.
Loreen: Dunno yet. We'll see. What's the time your end?

13731489,"Henning: You wanna hear something weird?
Max: yes, always!
Henning: Recently somehow we talked about waiters/waitresses. And the Louis's interpretation was that in Italy they are so nice, because they are so lowly and cannot afford to be demanding and have to be servile, basically.
Henning: And in France they are arrogant, because they can afford it.
Henning: Somehow, because their status is higher.
Max: LOL. Another beautiful theory - nationalist in its core, after all.
Henning: And I agree with neither the first nor the second assessment.
Max: me neither. Being honest I don't see huge differences throughout Europe. It happens to me to meet a very nice waiter here and there, and grumpy people as well
Henning: No, so far i find Italian waiters much nicer and much less professional than in Germany. But I wouldn't venture any theories about the countries.
Max: Jakob (the Slovene) told me after coming back from Berlin that waiters there are so much less nice than here in Italy. While Jakob (the Pole) always complains about them being so rude in comparison with Poland.
Henning: Berlin is a big city though
Max: And I am starting to think that all those theories say more about their authors than about the waiters and the countries. They are always nationally framed, which is stupid
Henning: Maybe. Also our position, when I am in a restaurant in Germany I am often with my family, in Italy with a bunch of fun young, foreign people.
Max: Paris is a different world than Bretagne I assume. In a small village. Of course, there is more of talking, touching, joking in Italy. But people in Germany, in Landshut are also more talkative than in Munich. That's all, I believe. Aaso it depends how touristic the place is, etc.
Max: It's also about the general culture of eating out, talking to waiters, anonymity of the big city. 
Max: Especially between societies as diverse and generally as similar as France and Italy, just think about Genova and Nice!
Max: just bullshit! Luis is so communists but keeps blushing conservative and nationalist stuff.
Max: And in Poland they are sometimes super nice - new American-style capitalist and servile and sometimes the ""communist"" remnants.Throwing your plate in front of you with a hostile ""proszĘ"" with a long accent on the hiper-correct ""ę"".
Max: And then one is confused about his/her judgements and builds new ones. But maybe we just don't need to read everything through this national framework. I agree that there is a lot about it, or about culture/climate/language/whatever, but we just exaggerate all the time.
Max: even me! The single biggest anti-nationalist of Europe 🤣

13819187,"Victor: Hi everyone! I guess it’s time for a debrief
Victor: We’ve organised an event, started promotion two weeks before it started. 27 People registered in total and 21 showed up in the end
Victor: I tend to think the event itself went smoothly and the speakers performed well.
Victor: There was some engagement between the audience and the speakers, although for the future I would try and think of strategies to foster more engagement
Victor: Few people showed up for the drinks afterwards, which personally surprised me because that was the part we actually ended up advertising the most.
Victor: And when it comes to our performance as a team, I’d say everything went smoothly! If I had to think of things to improve though, I’d say that we could communicate more swiftly and that info necessary for the event to go ahead as planned should be shared so that if one of us happens to be unavailable, busy, etc. others can swiftly take his/her task over.
Victor: I’d be happy to know what your thoughts are 🤗
Tony: Heyyyyyyy
Tony: I agree with you on everything lol
Tony: Yer, for the future it’d be good to start promotion beforehand. I’m actually still surprised that so many people came in the end
Tony: The point about sharing important info is very much to the point
Tony: ⚫️⚪️
Alice: Hey! Well, thanks to Tony for his relentless efforts to promote the event via Twitter. I’ve followed the “campaign” and think it was really good
Alice: I don’t take the thing about info and being busy personally, although I have to recognise I did withhold some info that was much needed and my timing wasn’t very good either.
Alice: I can take care of setting up a google sheets document where we’ll be able to put important info to be shared w/ other committee members
Alice: What do you think?
Victor: 🤩 That sounds terrific actually! Thanks
Victor: And no worries, this was our first event so we knew from the start it couldn’t be perfect
Alice: 😊
Victor: Well, I think we can congratulate ourselves both on the event and on the nice and fruitful debrief 🍒🍌🍉🤣
